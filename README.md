### ⭐️ Feature Selection is the New Factor Modeling

Traditional factor model is based on linear regression, with all its attendant shortcomings. The machine learning technique of feature selection can take into account nonlinearity, collinearity, and interdependence of such factors in returns prediction or attribution.
